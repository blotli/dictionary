# Dictionary

**[Searchable Version](https://jake-knerr.github.io/dictionary/)**

This dictionary grew out of an effort to define any terms I did not understand. Some of the terms herein are pretty basic, but as they say, one has to start somewhere.

Feel free to create an issue or open a pull request if a term is incorrect or you want to add more.

Also, please star this repository if you find it useful. Thanks!

## Structure

Term definitions are grouped by the first letter in the term, just like in a standard dictionary.

The first sentence of the definition is the _summary_. The summary has an implied subject that is the term being defined and concisely answers the question, "What does [insert term here] mean?" Also, the summary may be a sentence fragment. Any further sentences in the definition are complete sentences.
